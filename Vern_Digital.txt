## Project Update Log: Automated Chatbot Configuration
Date: October 8, 2025

SUCCESS: End-to-End Automation Workflow Complete
The primary goal of creating an automated configuration pipeline has been achieved. The n8n workflow is fully operational and successfully processes a client's training data, creating a complete, structured configuration in a firestore cloud database. This provides the foundation for clearer operations and faster client onboarding.

Key Milestones Achieved:

Live Data Ingestion: A webhook was configured to successfully receive detailed client data from the 'train your chatbot' page and file uploads from the frontend training form, automating the "Discovery & Analysis" step of a new project.

Dynamic Content Generation: The workflow dynamically processes the incoming data to:

Generate a unique customerID for each client.

Consolidate various text inputs into a structured knowledge_base.

Use an AI model to generate a hyper-personalized system_prompt.

Assemble a config_json object with client metadata.

Database Integration: The architecture was pivoted from writing local files to a more scalable solution. The workflow now connects directly to a Firebase Firestore database.

Final Output: For each new client, the workflow now automatically creates a new, unique document in Firestore containing the complete and correctly formatted knowledge_base, system_prompt, and config_json. This data is ready to be used by the central Python backend.
